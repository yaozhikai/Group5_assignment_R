these changes have on New Zealand's tourism industry?

and 2022, and what factors might explain these changes?
2. Compared from May 2022 to June 2024, how have monthly/weekly visitor numbers
fluctuated across these period, and what factors might explain these changes?
3. Which countries have seen the most significant changes in visitor numbers, and what
are the potential reasons for these changes?
4. How do visitor characteristics, such as age group, length of stay, and travel purpose,
vary across different citizenship groups?
