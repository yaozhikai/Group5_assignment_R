### Main Problem
How have international visitor trends changed over the past five years, and what impact do
these changes have on New Zealand's tourism industry?

### Sub-Problems
1. Compared to 2023, how have year visitor numbers fluctuated across 2019, 2020, 2021
and 2022, and what factors might explain these changes?
2. Compared from May 2022 to June 2024, how have monthly/weekly visitor numbers
fluctuated across these period, and what factors might explain these changes?
3. Which countries have seen the most significant changes in visitor numbers, and what
are the potential reasons for these changes?
4. How do visitor characteristics, such as age group, length of stay, and travel purpose,
vary across different citizenship groups?
5. What are the geographic patterns of entry, and how do these patterns correlate with
the closest international flight ports?

Lecture's additional comment: since you are doing 5 years, how about do a thorough analytics on pre-in-post covid analysis?

###
I've used the record of 28 Jul downloaded earlier, while the most up to date csv file is in the following link (foreign visitors). Please change the readcsv function when using new files.
Please download the csv file and put it with project file in the same wd.
The draft is still a work in progress and needs further discussion and polishing.https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Provisional-international-travel-statistics/Provisional-international-travel-statistics-week-ended-04Aug2024.zip

If we can find a CSV file with previous 5 years data, it might better support our data analysis.
